            The platform’s economic logic depends on extracting, inferring, and circulating personal data to make targeting effective. When third parties or internal systems overreach, the harm is continuous with the model’s core function rather than a deviation from it. (targeted Advertising)

            Once identity and behavior are convertible to ad inventory, the surface area for leaks, misuse, or coercive design grows with every new integration and optimization. (Business Pages, Advertising)

            The cited privacy crises [4][5] illustrate this inevitability: they emerge where dense user graphs meet business tooling and granular targeting, making privacy failures a byproduct of the same mechanisms that power growth. ([4][5])

            In short: the features that make connection seamless also make surveillance tractable at scale; the platform cannot maximize ad efficiency without deep visibility into users. (profiles, sharing, Messenger → Advertising)
